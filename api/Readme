Style Selector App with AI Chatbot

Overview

The Style Selector App is a web application that allows users to create, manage, and share UI style configurations using Tailwind CSS and Bootstrap classes. It includes an AI-powered chatbot (to be implemented) for suggesting styles based on user input. This project is a solo development effort to build a full-stack application with a Django REST Framework (DRF) backend and a React frontend (to be added). As of Day 3 (August 4, 2025), the backend includes user authentication (register, login, logout) and style management APIs, secured with JWT.

Features (Current)





User Authentication:





Register: Create a user account (POST /api/auth/register/).



Login: Obtain JWT access/refresh tokens (POST /api/auth/login/).



Logout: Blacklist refresh token (POST /api/auth/logout/).



Style Management:





Create, list, retrieve, update, and delete style configurations (/api/styles/).



Styles are linked to authenticated users and include platform (Tailwind/Bootstrap), component type, name, and CSS classes.



Tech Stack:





Backend: Django 4.2, DRF 3.15, Django Simple JWT 5.3



Database: SQLite (development)



Authentication: JWT with token blacklisting



Tools: Python 3.11, Postman, Git

Planned Features

AI chatbot for style suggestions (/api/chatbot/suggest/, Day 4).

Community library for sharing public styles (Days 5â€“6).
